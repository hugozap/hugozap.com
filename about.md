Hi, I'm Hugo. 

I'm a web creator. I enjoy building
tools using Web Technologies.

My current areas of interest are:

- Creating tools to facilitate the teaching of complex concepts.
- Use Web technologies to improve learning resources accessibility.
- Creative coding.
- Descentralized web technologies.
- Exploring ways to improve developer/designer collaboration. (See [react-svgmt](https://github.com/hugozap/react-svgmt))
