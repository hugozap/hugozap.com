Last week I released version 1 of [react-rotary-knob](https://github.com/hugozap/react-rotary-knob/). One of the cool things of the component is the support for custom skins. Yesterday I released a Skin pack with 18 cool skins. The skins are JS modules that can be easily imported and customized (just set the `skin` attribute of the Knob to the imported module).
