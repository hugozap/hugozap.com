Wrapping a datasource in a node stream.

Streams are my favorite thing, their simplicity makes it fun to solve problems with them.
One of the common problems we find is converting a data source to some stream so we can make use of the stream utils.

## About the Data source.

It may be a database, some hardware sensor or whatever data source that
has the following:

- method to  start reading data
- return the data in some event : e.g "data"
- stop returning data.

Thats it, nothing more is needed from the data source.

## Creating a Readable stream that wraps our datasource

( From: http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_event_readable )

Important points:

* _read just tells the datasource to start emitting data events, it does not actually push data because the datasource returns the data in events

* the result of this.push(...) tells us if the stream should stop reading data.
