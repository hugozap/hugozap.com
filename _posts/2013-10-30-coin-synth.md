Analog interfaces are cool, i can't explain why but touching things with
different textures is cooler than always using a touchscreen, at least 
for now that touchscreens don't have texture changing capabilities.

Last weekend i worked on a little project that uses coins as touch
surface to play some cool sound effects. The result is this:

This was possible with the makey makey and a little node script to map keys to the sounds.
