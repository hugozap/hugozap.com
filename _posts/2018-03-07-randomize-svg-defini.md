When using inline SVG's a duplicated definition element id's will cause problems as the browser will use the first SVG definition with the id.

I created a tool to randomize id's, you can find it here:

If for some reason the link is broken, [here's the gist](https://gist.github.com/hugozap/a0b96b14d25bad83cbe73b0d21d182d9) (it's a single html file)
