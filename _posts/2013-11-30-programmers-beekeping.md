##Beekeeping

>Here's the secret that every successful software company is based on:
>You can domesticate programmers the way beekeepers tame bees. You
>can't exactly communicate with them, but you can get them to swarm in
>one place and when they're not looking, you can carry off the honey.

>You keep these bees from stinging by paying them money. More money
>than they know what to do with.  But that's less than you might think.
>You see, all these programmers keep hearing their fathers' voices in
>their heads saying "When are you going to join the real world?" All
>you have to pay them is enough money that they can answer (also in
>their heads) "Jeez, Dad, I'm making more than you." On average, this
>is cheap.

>And you get them to stay in the hive by giving them other coders to
>swarm with. The only person whose praise matters is another
>programmer. Less-talented programmers will idolize them; evenly
>matched ones will challenge and goad one another; and if you want to
>get a good swarm, you make sure that you have at least one certified
>genius coder that they can all look up to, even if he glances at other
