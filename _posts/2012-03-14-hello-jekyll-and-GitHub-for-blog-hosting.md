I was looking for alternatives to wordpress blogs, because although i like wordpress, i don't like to waste time upgrading or making backups for my blog, i found the article [Blogging like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) and really like the concept of using the console ,a text editor and Git to manage my blog without having to install databases or configure webservers. Github makes this possible.

Another tool i used was [http://jekyllbootstrap.com](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) to save some time configuring the site structure

## What's this blog about

I hope to write about entrepreneurship, web and mobile innovation and other cool topics that i like and spend time learning.
Constant motivation is important for me, so i will share links that can help others to find the motivation they need to release cool things.

English is not my native language so grammar errors are expected,  i hope they are not that bad.
