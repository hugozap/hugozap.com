Next Saturday i will be presenting about a topic i'm very interested in. Streams in JavaScript.

It's a great opportunity to share knowledge with the BogotaJS. Teaching has become very important for me , it's a greaty way to master a topic of my preference and everytime i connect with some like minded people. 

I've been a little distant from the local communities, some years ago i was very active and gave some talks that people seemed to enjoy. I realized that talking in front of a knowledge-hungry audience is one of the things i enjoy the most. It scares me a little every time but i always learn new things. 


Where: Bogot√°, Colombia
When : Saturday Dec 6th 2014.
