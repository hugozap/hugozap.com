The topic of personal energy management is something i'm really interested in. I think it's critical for achieving success and we don't pay attention to it.

## What is energy management?

I's the art and science of reviewing your daily routine to detect the activities and situations that drain your energy, make you feel fatigued or replenish your energy, know when to take breaks, and your brain capacity to perform.

## Some things to consider

### Paying attention to your sleep, it's not only the number of hours you sleep that count.

Have you noticed that there are some days you sleep a lot  and feel more tired than if you had not slept at all?.

I learnt about sleep cycles and you should too,  there is a good way to wake up 


### Whats your peak productivity moment in the day?

### Are you respecting your time?

### How do you fight against the monkey mind?
