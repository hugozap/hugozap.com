title: 5 Shortcuts that you must absolutely know in Eclipse and Visual Studio
published: true
---


There are many shortcuts to learn but if you want to improve your productivity you must be able to quickly do the following tasks:

* Quickly open a class by typing a part of its name
* Quickly add a namespace import/using statement without moving to the header of the file
* Duplicate a line
* Go to a method quickly 
* Navigate to the class/method definition

The idea is that you don't use your mouse , go to menu items etc.. This generates micro distractions that summed up affect your productivity.


## In Eclipse

###  Quickly open a class by typing a part of its name:
      Ctrl+Shift+T
### Quickly add a namespace import/using statement without moving to the header of the file: 
    Control+1 when the caret is on the type that needs an import. Control+1 is very useful for other contextual actions too
### Duplicate a line:
     Control+ALT+DownArrow
### Go to a method quickly: 
    Control+O and begin typing the name of the method 
### Navigate to the class/method definition
     F3

## In Visual Studio


### Quickly open a class (Or any file) by typing a part of its name : 
    I use the extension called Sonic File Finder, there are other ways too
    * Install the extension http://www.jens-schaller.de/sonictools/sonicfilefinder/index.
    * Press Control+Shift+Y to open the search panel and begin typing


### Quickly add a namespace import/using statement without moving to the header of the file: 
    Alt+Shift+F10 opens the quick actions panel with contextual actions , one of them adds required using statements

### Duplicate a line:
    I recently discovered that Visual Studio indeed has duplicate line shortcut, however it appears few people know about it
    The shortcut:
        Without any selected text press Ctrl+C Control+V

### Go to a method quickly:
    This works to find any word quickly, you need to install the Visual Studio Productivity Power Tools and just by typing Control+F you can see the results of your search as you type.

### Navigate to the class/method definition
    F12

I find myself using this shortcuts constantly when developing for Android and .NET (Mostly ASP MVC Web Apps)
