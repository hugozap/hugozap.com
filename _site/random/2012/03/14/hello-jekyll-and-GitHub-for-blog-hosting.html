    <p>I was looking for alternatives to wordpress blogs, because although i like wordpress, i don’t like to waste time upgrading or making backups for my blog, i found the article <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">Blogging like a hacker</a> and really like the concept of using the console ,a text editor and Git to manage my blog without having to install databases or configure webservers. Github makes this possible.</p>

<p>Another tool i used was <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com">http://jekyllbootstrap.com</a> to save some time configuring the site structure</p>

<h2 id="whats-this-blog-about">What’s this blog about</h2>

<p>I hope to write about entrepreneurship, web and mobile innovation and other cool topics that i like and spend time learning.
Constant motivation is important for me, so i will share links that can help others to find the motivation they need to release cool things.</p>

<p>English is not my native language so grammar errors are expected,  i hope they are not that bad.</p>
