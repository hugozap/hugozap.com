<p>I was playing with node.js in linux and wanted to try a js IDE (In Windows i use Notepad++ for web coding (With a lot of snippets)). i read something about Cloud9 some time ago but didn’t pay too much attention thinking it was a cool IDE only avalaible online. I was wrong, you can download it and install it locally so i gave it a try.</p>

<p>You can check the steps to install it <a href="http://www.cambus.net/setting-up-a-node-js-development-environment-with-npm-and-cloud9-ide-installed-locally/">here:</a></p>

<p>I was looking for some way to start cloud9 in the folder i chose, and launch the default web browser to the Cloud9 local installation.</p>

<p>By following the steps in <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1813076">this forum post</a> i was able to create a shell script that asks for a folder.</p>

<p><strong>(I installed node with sudo so i needed to provide the password. I modified the script to capture it.)</strong></p>

<p>(with the  xdg-open command is possible to launch the default web browser.)</p>

<p>The final script (make sure you have zenity installed, it’s required for the dialogs)</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class="nv">PROJECT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>zenity <span class="nt">--file-selection</span> <span class="nt">--directory</span> <span class="nt">--title</span> <span class="s1">'Select a Project Directory'</span><span class="k">)</span>

  <span class="nb">sleep </span>3
   xdg-open http://localhost:3000
<span class="k">fi
</span><span class="nb">exit</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>##Some notes</p>

<ul>
  <li>zenity is the linux tool used to display a prompt window and capture parameters for shell scripts</li>
  <li>The first two lines display dialogs to capture the parameters</li>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>This line: echo ${PASS}</td>
          <td>sudo -S $HOME/cloud9/bin/cloud9.sh -w “${PROJECT}” -p 3000 &amp;</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <ul>
      <li>Sends the password parameter to the sudo command (-S is used to capture stdin )</li>
      <li>The cloud9 launcher accepts -w (for setting parameter) and -p (changing the port)</li>
      <li>The last character of the line &amp; allows the script to execute the following command (open the browser) at the same time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sleep 3  is need so the browser opens when the cloud9 app is already initialized.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I love linux versatility and learning about the command line. With good IDE’s like Cloud9 that cost zero, there is no excuse to release cool products</p>
