<p>Last week I released version 1 of <a href="https://github.com/hugozap/react-rotary-knob/">react-rotary-knob</a>. One of the cool things of the component is the support for custom skins. Yesterday I released a Skin pack with 18 cool skins. The skins are JS modules that can be easily imported and customized (just set the <code class="highlighter-rouge">skin</code> attribute of the Knob to the imported module).</p>
