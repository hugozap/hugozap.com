    <p>A few days ago I was part of a BogotaJS event where each of the presenters had
to talk about a new ES6 feature. The topic I chose was ES6 Proxies. I read about them in the past but didn’t pay too much attention. Turns out they are cool.</p>

<p>What are they for?</p>

<p>Proxies allow the developer to intercept typical operations with JS objects like setting a property, getting its value, enumerating it’s own properties and others.</p>

<p>The interesting part is that the default behavior can be overriden, so for example if the user tries to access a non existent property, a default one can be returned (instead of undefined)</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">handler</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">target</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">key</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">'you are trying to access:'</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="nx">key</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="na">nombre</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'John'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">edad</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">60</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">proxy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Proxy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">handler</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Name:'</span><span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">proxy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">nombre</span><span class="p">)</span> 
<span class="c1">// Outputs: Name: you are trying to access:name</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In the code above we rendered our object useless by always returning
the string ‘you are trying to access:PROPERTY’ instead of the object value</p>

<p>Some interesting things that can be done with proxies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intercept a property assignment operation and run validation logic to set the final value</li>
  <li>Reject modification of object properties starting with a character like underscore</li>
  <li>Expire objects ( revocable proxies ). This will throw an error on most object operations</li>
  <li>Do some crazy stuff like parsing the name of a non existant function and return a custom function based on that.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another not very practical example (but with potential applications). This proxy makes it possible to chain non existant properties and prints them to the console.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">handler</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="nx">handler</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kd">get</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">target</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">key</span><span class="p">){</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">key</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Proxy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(){},</span> <span class="nx">handler</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Proxy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">handler</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nx">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hola</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">amigos</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">c</span><span class="err">ó</span><span class="nx">mo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">est</span><span class="err">á</span><span class="nx">n</span><span class="p">();</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This would print the string “hola amigos como están”. 
The trick is to return the same handler whenever a property value 
is requested. It doesn’t matter if the property exists.</p>

<p>Besides obvious uses like instrumentation or validation
there may be creative uses of proxies out there worth exploring.</p>
