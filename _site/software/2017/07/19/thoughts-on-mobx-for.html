<p>I&#8217;ve been working with MobX for a while and these are some
of the lessons I&#8217;ve learned. Some of them are personal
preferences. I feel there&#8217;s still a lot of exploration to do before
standard patterns emerge that answer the question of how to structure the application state with mobx.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> There are some libraries out there that help to structure the stores. In this post I&#8217;m interested in exploring solutions with plain mobx before introducing more concepts and dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="split-ui-and-application-state">Split UI and Application State?</h2>

<p>When learning mobx I found a recommendation somewhere on
having a store for UI related stuff and another for 
application model stuff. This sounds good in theory, 
however as both UI and App stores started growing some issues appeared:</p>

<p>Properties in the UI state may belong to different logical groups, so
having them in the same artifact (The UIState mobx store) didn&#8217;t feel good,
when working on a feature, I&#8217;m not interested in UI state properties that belong to another feature and scanning
the file looking for them was annoying.</p>

<p>Based on the previous reflection, I realized that the distinction of UI state vs App State was not being helpful for the project. A mobx store is an application artifact and everything there has to do with the UI, so instead of having a separated store for UI things, we now have 1 store per logical unit. In our case we chose subsystems like authentication,search,admin etc, but I guess this depends on the nature of the project.</p>

<h2 id="domain-logic-on-mobx-stores">Domain logic on mobx Stores</h2>

<p>With computed fields, some logic can be included in the mobx stores. It&#8217;s easy to start adding domain logic there, however I don&#8217;t think this is a good idea. Mobx stores are just an mechanism to update the view in a smart way, but they are a technical artifact. Domain model rules should not have anything to do with mobx terminology.</p>

<p>A better approach is to have the business rules in another module that nows nothing about mobx. From the mobx store, it&#8217;s easy to have a computed field that delegates the calculation to the domain logic module(s).</p>

<p>Testing the domain rules is easier if they are separated from the mobx terminology.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-structure-a-store">How to structure a store?</h2>

<p>For complex UI&#8217;s the stores can get pretty messy and navigating them can be tricky. A mix of properties, computed fields and actions can turn into spaguetti. A practical solution to this problems include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If using a single file per store, group properties, actions and computed fields (Some people may prefer to group them by logical concerns)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Move actions to a separated file: With this approach, the mobx store gets splitted into multiple files</p>

    <p>An example stores structure:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>search(Search Store folder)
        <ul>
          <li>store.js (properties are declared there, actions are imported here)</li>
          <li>actions.js (extract the actions into a separate file)</li>
          <li>computed.js (Worthy if there&#8217;s a lot of computed fields)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>users (Users Store folder)
        <ul>
          <li>store.js</li>
          <li>actions.js</li>
          <li>computed.js</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Structuring stores this way has the benefit of making it easy to locate things. When working in a feature
we can jump quickly to the related properties or actions of the feature/subsystem we are working on ignoring
everything else.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Everything in the mobx store is related to the UI so group by logical units (subsystems, entities, use cases) instead of UI vs App State.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Place domain logic in plain JS modules (that now nothing of MobX terminology) and import them from your stores</li>
  <li>Experiment with different Store layouts. Optimize for maintenability.</li>
</ul>
