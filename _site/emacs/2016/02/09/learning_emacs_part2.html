<p>I find some errors in my emacs config and try to solve them by modifying the .emacs file (using emacs), a small test of basic navigation, saving and locks.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ok so I started emacs and I get some warning saying that something is wrong with the configuration. As suggested I start emacs with the &#8211;debug-init option.</p>

<p>The error says:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>void-variable viper-vi-global
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So I looked and viper provides some vi emulation. I&#8217;m not interested in that and don&#8217;t remember why I messed with that in the past or how it got there.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m not interested in that so I will remove that plugin. But how?</p>

<p>&#8230;</p>

<p>I now remember that in my first attempt to learn emacs I installed a package called &#8216;ace-jump&#8217; and pasted some setup on my .emacs file located on 
     /Users/myusername/.emacs</p>

<p>The culprit was this line I didn&#8217;t pay attention to:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>;;If you use viper mode :
(define-key viper-vi-global-user-map (kbd "SPC") 'ace-jump-mode)
;;If you use evil
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I deleted those lines using (from emacs!).  using the basic commands for movement (next/previous/forwared/backwards)</p>

<ul>
  <li>C-n to move to next line (next)</li>
  <li>C-p to move to previous line (previous)</li>
  <li>C-b (backwards to previous character)</li>
  <li>C-f (forwards to next character)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also C-v to jump to the next visible Screen</p>

<p>Not sure how to select text, tried Shift and right arrow to set a mark to highlight the paragraph and then Backspace. It worked.</p>

<p>How to delete the current line?
&#8230;googles&#8230;</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C-Shift Backspace
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Google answer summary says that I can execute kill-whole-line command but I don&#8217;t know how to run a command yet.</p>

<p>How to save the file? 
&#8230;googles&#8230;</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C-x s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a good time to search for a Cheat sheet. So I google and find this one that looks good. I&#8217;ll print it:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf">https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf</a></p>

<p>Now I try to open a file from emacs</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C-x f
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I can type the path, autocomplete works but I get a list of possible options that match the current path. (not visible here: emacs colors one letter of each option)</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>In this buffer, type RET to select the completion near point.
Possible completions are:
.eclipse/                 .eclipse_keyring          .electron/
.emacs                    .emacs.d/                 .emacs~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I assume RET is return? (I press Enter and it didn&#8217;t work as expected, a new file with the partial name .em was created and I wanted to open .emacs ) I don&#8217;t know yet how to manage buffers so I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m doing something wrong.</p>

<p>So I repeat</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C-x f
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this time using just TAB to keep autocompleting until all the file name is written.</p>

<p>I open the file and need to search for some text.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C-s let's you search forward
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the search the cursor is positioned on the line I need to delete. 
(For some reason C-S Backspace is not working here)</p>

<p>Another way to delete is (going to the beginning of the line and delete until end)</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C-a
C-k
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I did some characters erroneusly, let&#8217;s look how to undo&#8230;</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C-x u
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point I repeat the key combination and must have activated another commands because I&#8217;m now on other buffer. That&#8217;s not what I want. abort mission (C-z) and try again.</p>

<p>I open emacs again, and when trying to save the file I get</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/Users/hugozap/.emacs locked by hugozap@hugoz... (pid 45537): (s, q, p, ?)?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What does those options mean? let&#8217;s investigate&#8230;</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Interlocking.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Interlocking.html</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>s = Steal the lock</li>
  <li>p = Proceed</li>
  <li>q = quit</li>
</ul>

<p>I use option &#8216;s&#8217; to steal the lock and then write the file with</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C-x s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Restart emacs and everything&#8217;s ok (First Win)</p>

<h3 id="next">Next</h3>

<p>From the quick documentation review I&#8217;ve done I keep finding tips like &#8220;Run this command&#8221;, &#8220;set this variable&#8221;, etc. I don&#8217;t know how to do that yet, and will make a jump to understanding some of the basic Lisp for emacs now.</p>
