<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>I will be logging my progress towards learning Emacs and replace Sublime Text as my main text editor. (Sublime is great, and recently it looks like work on it has resumed!)</p>

<p>In the past I&#8217;ve tried to learn it but quickly lost the motivation (or just forgot about it) and just kept using Sublime Text. This time I&#8217;m doing it for the fun of learning a well tested and respected UNIX tool, the challenge of learning Common Lisp, investing in a tool that will be around X years in the future and as a personal challenge that involves overcoming the initial frustation of not being able to do basic things. Feeling like a noob.</p>

<p>I considered Vim and may learn it in the future, however right know (not knowing any of the two) I&#8217;m more inclined to Common Lisp for customization purposes over Vimscript. Also, I&#8217;m interested in Org mode and I hope to get into that later.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>The main goal is to feel proficient with Emacs to the same level I&#8217;m with Sublime and more (Learning how to create plugins for it, which I haven&#8217;t done in Sublime either).</p>

<p>This is a vague goal, so I wrote a list of questions/use cases I should be able to do with Emacs. I divided into &#8220;Essentials&#8221; and &#8220;Power features&#8221;. Learning all the essentials will put me at the same level of my Sublime Text knowledge.</p>
