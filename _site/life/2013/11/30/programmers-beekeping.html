<p>##Beekeeping</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here&#8217;s the secret that every successful software company is based on:
You can domesticate programmers the way beekeepers tame bees. You
can&#8217;t exactly communicate with them, but you can get them to swarm in
one place and when they&#8217;re not looking, you can carry off the honey.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You keep these bees from stinging by paying them money. More money
than they know what to do with.  But that&#8217;s less than you might think.
You see, all these programmers keep hearing their fathers&#8217; voices in
their heads saying &#8220;When are you going to join the real world?&#8221; All
you have to pay them is enough money that they can answer (also in
their heads) &#8220;Jeez, Dad, I&#8217;m making more than you.&#8221; On average, this
is cheap.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And you get them to stay in the hive by giving them other coders to
swarm with. The only person whose praise matters is another
programmer. Less-talented programmers will idolize them; evenly
matched ones will challenge and goad one another; and if you want to
get a good swarm, you make sure that you have at least one certified
genius coder that they can all look up to, even if he glances at other</p>
