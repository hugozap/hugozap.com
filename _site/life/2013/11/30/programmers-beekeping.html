<p>##Beekeeping</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s the secret that every successful software company is based on:
You can domesticate programmers the way beekeepers tame bees. You
can’t exactly communicate with them, but you can get them to swarm in
one place and when they’re not looking, you can carry off the honey.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You keep these bees from stinging by paying them money. More money
than they know what to do with.  But that’s less than you might think.
You see, all these programmers keep hearing their fathers’ voices in
their heads saying “When are you going to join the real world?” All
you have to pay them is enough money that they can answer (also in
their heads) “Jeez, Dad, I’m making more than you.” On average, this
is cheap.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And you get them to stay in the hive by giving them other coders to
swarm with. The only person whose praise matters is another
programmer. Less-talented programmers will idolize them; evenly
matched ones will challenge and goad one another; and if you want to
get a good swarm, you make sure that you have at least one certified
genius coder that they can all look up to, even if he glances at other</p>
