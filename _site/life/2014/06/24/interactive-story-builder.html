<p>There is a lot of opportunities to use mobile for rich interactive stories,
one of the problems authors face is that creating those apps requires a large investment that is not easy to recover with the app sales.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m working in a product that makes it easier and cheaper for authors to create
the app with a nice GUI, and package it as a mobile app.  I have a basic prototype and is nice to be able to create basic interactions without having to code.</p>

<p>One great thing of text based adventure games is that you have to use your imagination more, i plan to have a mix of visuals / text so you still use your imagination but with some visuals / audio to enrich the atmosphere.</p>

<p>This is a preview</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking into funding options, so i can work on this platform full time. 
I see a lot of potential and a lot of authors would benefit from this platform.</p>

<p>My roadmap to ship it is:</p>

<p>1) Look for funding while working part time 
2) Finishing version 0.1 with a minimal but useful set of features
3) Invite some author(s) to give it a try to get feedback and iterate
4) Keep improving it, add more people to the team and release a v1</p>

<p>If you are interested in following the process you can follow me on twitter 
or send me an email.</p>
