<p>I think is a great example of good parenting. 
Kids are much more capable than we think, they have lots of energy and can grasp concepts really quickly.</p>

<p>Most schools are not ideal to make the most of their creative potential, fortunately in this time there are lots of resources for kids to experiment play and harness their creative habilities.</p>

<p>Insted of wasting hours in front of a tv, motivate your children
to create cool new things.</p>
