<p>In 2014 I presented a talk called &#8220;The Power of Streams in JS&#8221; for the BogotaJS meetup group.</p>

<p>Recently I found the slides and realized that they may be useful for developers learning how streams work in node.</p>

<p>Streams in node are great, quoting Dominic Tarr:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Streams in node are one of the rare occasions when doing something the fast way is actually easier. SO USE THEM. not since bash has streaming been introduced into a high level language as nicely as it is in node.&#8221; @dominictarr</p>

<p>Readable streams emit data generated from a data source</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/img/streamsslides/writeable.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Writable streams are used to write chunks to a data source</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/img/streamsslides/transform.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Transform streams read and process chunks of data and emit them</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/img/streamsslides/duplex.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Duplex Streams have two &#8220;modes&#8221; they can act as writtable streams by receiving chunks and writing them to some datasource, and they can emit chunks of data read from another datasource.</p>

<p>input and output are independent of each other.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/img/streamsslides/concat.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Concat streams read all the input chunks and create one  grouped chunk of data (e.g from a chunk of words concatenate into a String)</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/img/streamsslides/filter.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Filter streams work similar to .filter function for arrays. The only chunks that &#8220;pass&#8221; are the ones who satisfay some condition.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/img/streamsslides/split.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Split streams split a chunk of data using some separator.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/img/streamsslides/join.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A Join stream intersperse stream chunks with separators</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/img/streamsslides/linetoobject.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>With trough/through2 you can easily create transform streams. In this example the stream receives an array (each chunk is an array) and transform it into a JSON object.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="mux-demux">Mux-Demux</h2>

<p>Mux Demux is a technique that allows sending the data chunks of multiple (and different) streams over one channel and read them at the other side of the stream.</p>

<p>In the diagram a sample websocket using the Shoe package is used as the &#8216;channel&#8217; that will transport the data chunks from diverse streams.</p>
