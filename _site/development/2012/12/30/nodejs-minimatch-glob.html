<p>In my quest to learn nodejs i like to navigate github and randomly looking at popular nodejs repositories to see it&#8217;s tests and what problem it solves.</p>

<p>I was looking at Isaac Schlueter repositories ( he is the main developer of nodejs right now).
His github account is <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/">here</a></p>

<h2 id="minimatch">Minimatch</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch">Minimatch</a> is a minimal pattern matching library
It&#8217;s useful when you want a quick match and don&#8217;t want to write regular expressions directly</p>

<p>Eg.</p>

<p>Matching javascript files:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4416811.js?file=gistfile1.txt"> </script>

<p>Matching paths that end with /bin</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4416811.js?file=gistfile3.txt"> </script>

<p>##Glob</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob">Glob</a> is related to minimatch but navigates de filesystem and returns a list of paths that
match a minimatch expression. This is great to find a list of files or directory paths that match a given expression.</p>

<p><strong>The globbing concept in bash</strong></p>

<p>The concept of globbing is part of bash and this allows you to use some kind of filters to find files based on their path(where you cannot/don&#8217;t want to use regex directly)</p>

<p>For example if you want to find all the files that start with importantFileV and have xml extension you can use</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ls -l importantFileV?.xml 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This would return the following results</p>

<ul>
  <li>importantFileV1.xml, importantFileV2.xml, importantFileV3.xml</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some cool things you can do with globbing</p>

<p><strong>Find all files that start with  the word important</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ls -l important* 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Find all files that have version 1 to 5</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ls -l importantFileV\[1-5].js
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Find all the files that don&#8217;t have the word test in them</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ls -l [^test]*</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m using my blog for documenting my learning process, i hope someone finds this useful too.</p>
