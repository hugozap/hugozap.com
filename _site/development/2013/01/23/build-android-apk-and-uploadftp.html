<p>For the build process of a medium size project i&#8217;m working on, i need to generate the .apk and upload it to an ftp, i was doing this manually everytime i made changes, this is not optimal so i decided to create a bash script to automate the process.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-the-eclipse-project-for-ant-build">Preparing the eclipse project for ant build.</h3>

<p>To compile from the command line the build.xml file must created , the following command does that:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>android update -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now you can call</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ant debug
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To generate the .apk file inside the bin directory of your project. I needed to sign the .apk so instead of debug , release ant task must be called</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ant release
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Specifying the key store for apk signing</strong></p>

<p>My final goal is to upload the signed .apk to an ftp server, where other part of the build process takes place, to sign the .apk you must already have created a key store and alias that you can set in the file &#8220;ant.properties&#8221; (Create it in the root of your project)</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>key.store=/path/to/keystore
key.alias=alias name
key.store.password=YOUR_PASSWORD
key.alias.password=YOUR_PASSWORD
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Warning</strong></p>

<p>Take care when storing passwords in plain text, you can add ant.properties to your .gitignore if you dont want it in your repository.</p>

<h3 id="uploading-a-file-to-ftp-from-a-bash-script">Uploading a file to ftp from a bash script.</h3>

<p>I tried with the <strong>ftp</strong> command , however it wasn&#8217;t as straight as i tought.  The ftp command is not really meant to be used from the command line. A better alternative exists and is called <a href="http://www.ncftp.com/ncftp/">ncftp</a>.</p>

<p>(In mac install it with <strong>brew install ncftp</strong> if you have brew package manager)</p>

<p>The command to upload a file is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ncftpput -m -u $USER -p $PASS $SERVER $REMOTEDIR $TARGETFILE
</code></pre></div></div>
