<p>A lot of things have been said about  Google Glass, people make jokes about it, and a lot of hype is about being creepy, looking ridiculous, etc.</p>

<p>This sounds familiar, the same story happened with the IPad , people made jokes, upload funny pictures, and <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=lw#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;site=webhp&amp;q=%22ipad+will+fail%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;cad=b">failed predictions were abundant</a>;</p>

<p>I see a lot of possibilities with this kind of technologies. Google glass is part of the first iteration of products, and they will have flaws but will eventually be polished.</p>

<h2 id="ambient-sounds-to-text-with-google-glass">Ambient sounds to text with Google Glass.</h2>

<p>What if you are deaf and with some software and a mic, you could see the text that was converted from the ambient sounds. Something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/glass1.png" alt="glass1" /></p>

<p>With a powerful sound to text engine, this could improve the quality of life of deaf people. They would not need to read lips, and would be able to &#8220;listen&#8221; if someone behind them called them, someone shouts, an emergency alarm is triggered, etc.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really excited about the possibilities of this technology. People with dissabilities are a niche that could be possitively affected by this. Let&#8217;s hope an innovative ecosystem develops around this.</p>
