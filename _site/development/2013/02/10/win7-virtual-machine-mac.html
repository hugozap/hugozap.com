    <p>I’m very happy developing with my MacBook Air, even for heavy tasks like running the android emulator it works really well, i guess the solid state disk has a lot to do with it, i have a Windows 7 virtual machine with all the settings for .NET development, i wanted to try it in my mac .</p>

<p>The first thing i tried was looking for VMWare player for Mac but it doesn’t exist so i tried with VirtualBox.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-virtual-hard-drive">Using the virtual hard drive.</h2>

<p>In Virtual Box i started creating a new virtual machine and adding the .vmdk file that i copied from the VMWare virtual machine, this file has the hard drive contents.</p>

<h2 id="solving-boot-errors">Solving boot errors</h2>

<p>When i started the virtual machine in Virtual Box i got some boot errors and a blue screen, i spent some time and finally i could solve them doing the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Settings -&gt; System: Activate the “Enable IO APIC” option</li>
  <li>Settings -&gt; Storage: Use a SAS Controller instead of SCSI or IDE</li>
</ol>

<p>I deleted the default controller and added a SAS Controller for the hard drive. I’m not sure why this works but after doing that the Win7 machine started ok.</p>
