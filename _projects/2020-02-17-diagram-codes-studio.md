We are happy to announce [Diagram.codes Studio](https://studio.diagram.codes),
an improved desktop version of the web editor diagram.codes.

Some of its features include:

* Save/load diagram files locally
* Support for TeX expressions (Used for formulas, annotations ,etc)
* 10+ color themes

I'm very happy about this project, it started as a "scratch your own itch" product and now thousands of people are using it to share ideas, study and more.
